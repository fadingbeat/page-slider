# page-slider

The idea is to build an infinite image slider with jquery. The images should move left or right, depending on the arrow that is clicked. 


# Current functionality

- arrow click event moves the first image to the last position in the list

## Malfunctions

- image slide jumping
- same behavior with both left and right arrow click
- not infinite

## To do

- fix the slide image jumping
- write logic for right arrow click event
- write logic that will run the slider infinitely
- write logic that will operate on two image rows separately
