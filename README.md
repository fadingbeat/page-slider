# page-slider

The idea is to build an infinite image slider with jquery. The images should move left or right, depending on the arrow that is clicked. 


# Current functionality

- arrow click event moves the first image to the last position in the list

## Malfunctions

- same behavior with both left and right arrow click

## To do

- write logic that will operate on two image rows separately
- add animation 

#### Note:
This page slider is not responsive
